# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1. Start the program and import the NumPy library.

2. Define the given matrix as a 2D NumPy array.

3. Use the inv function from NumPy to calculate the inverse of the matrix.

4. Store the inverse matrix in a variable.

5. Display the inverse matrix as output.

 

## Program:
```python
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: SUDHARSANAN U
#RegisterNumber:212224230276

import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
b=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(b)
```
## Output:
